                    chapman billies leave the street, <br>
    And drouthy neibors, neibors, meet; <br>
    As market days are wearing late, <br>
    And folk begin to tak the gate, <br>
    While we sit bousing at the nappy, <br>
    An' getting fou and unco happy, <br>
    We think na on the lang Scots miles, <br>
    The mosses, waters, slaps and stiles, <br>
    That lie between us and our hame, <br>
    Where sits our sulky, sullen dame, <br>
    Gathering her brows like gathering storm, <br>
    Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This truth fand honest Tam o' Shanter, <br>

    For honest men and bonie lasses). </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise, <br>
      As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice! <br>
      She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, <br>
      A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum; <br>
      That frae November till October, <br>
      Ae market-day thou was na sober; <br>
      That ilka melder wi' the Miller, <br>
      Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; <br>
      That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on <br>
      The Smith and thee gat roarin' fou on; <br>
      That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday, <br>
      Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday, <br>
      She prophesied that late or soon, <br>
      Thou wad be found, deep drown'd in Doon, <br>
      Or catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk, <br>
      By Alloway's auld, haunted kirk. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet, <br>
        To think how mony counsels sweet, <br>
        How mony lengthen'd, sage advices, <br>
        The husband frae the wife despises! </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">But to our tale: Ae market night, <br>
          Tam had got planted unco right, <br>
          Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, <br>
          Wi reaming sAats, that drank divinely; <br>
          And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, <br>
          His ancient, trusty, drougthy crony: <br>
          Tam lo'ed him like a very brither; <br>
          They had been fou for weeks thegither. <br>
          The night drave on wi' sangs an' clatter; <br>
          And aye the ale was growing better: <br>
          The Landlady and Tam grew gracious, <br>
          Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious: <br>
          The Souter tauld his queerest stories; <br>
          The Landlord's laugh was ready chorus: <br>
          The storm without might rair and rustle, <br>
          Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Care, mad to see a man sae happy, <br>

            As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure, <br>
            The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure: <br>
            Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious, <br>
            O'er a' the ills o' life victorious! </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">But pleasures are like poppies spread, <br>
              You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; <br>
              Or like the snow falls in the river, <br>
              A moment white-then melts for ever; <br>
              Or like the Borealis race, <br>
              That flit ere you can point their place; <br>
              Or like the Rainbow's lovely form <br>
              Evanishing amid the storm. - <br>
              Nae man can tether Time nor Tide, <br>
              The hour approaches Tam maun ride; <br>
              That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane, <br>
              That dreary hour he mounts his beast in; <br>
              And sic a night he taks the road in, <br>
              As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last; <br>
                The rattling showers rose on the blast; <br>
                The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd; <br>
                Loud, deep, and lang, the thunder bellow'd: <br>
                That night, a child might understand, <br>
                The deil had business on his hand. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Weel-mounted on his grey mare, Meg, <br>
                  A better never lifted leg, <br>
                  Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire, <br>
                  Despising wind, and rain, and fire; <br>
                  Whiles holding fast his gude blue bonnet, <br>
                  Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet, <br>
                  Whiles glow'rin round wi' prudent cares, <br>
                  Lest bogles catch him unawares; <br>
                  Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, <br>
                  Where ghaists and houlets nightly cry. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">By this time he was cross the ford, <br>
                  Where in the snaw the chapman smoor'd; <br>
                  And past the birks and meikle stane, <br>
                  Where drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane; <br>
                  And thro' the whins, and by the cairn, <br>
                  Where hunters fand the murder'd bairn; <br>
                  And near the thorn, aboon the well, <br>
                  Where Mungo's mither hang'd hersel'. <br>
                  Before him Doon pours all his floods, <br>
                  The doubling storm roars thro' the woods, <br>
                  The lightnings flash from pole to pole, <br>
                  Near and more near the thunders roll, <br>
                  When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees, <br>
                  Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze, <br>
                  Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, <br>
                  And loud resounded mirth and dancing. </font></p>

                  Wi' usquabae, we'll face the devil! <br>
                  The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, <br>
                  Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle, <br>
                  But Maggie stood, right sair astonish'd, <br>
                  Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd, <br>
                  She ventur'd forward on the light; <br>

                  But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels, <br>
                  Put life and mettle in their heels. <br>
                  A winnock-bunker in the east, <br>
                  There sat auld Nick, in shape o' beast; <br>
                  A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, <br>
                  To gie them music was his charge: <br>
                  He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl, <br>
                  Till roof and rafters a' did dirl. - <br>
                  Coffins stood round, like open presses, <br>
                  That shaw'd the Dead in their last dresses; <br>
                  And (by some devilish cantraip sleight) <br>
                  Each in its cauld hand held a light. <br>
                  By which heroic Tam was able <br>
                  To note upon the haly table, <br>
                  A murderer's banes, in gibbet-airns; <br>
                  Twa span-lang, wee, unchristened bairns; <br>
                  A thief, new-cutted frae a rape, <br>
                  Wi' his last gasp his gabudid gape; <br>
                  Five tomahawks, wi' blude red-rusted: <br>
                  Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted; <br>
                  A garter which a babe had strangled: <br>
                  A knife, a father's throat had mangled. <br>
                  Whom his ain son of life bereft, <br>
                  The grey-hairs yet stack to the heft; <br>
                  Wi' mair of horrible and awfu', <br>
                  Which even to name wad be unlawfu'. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd, and curious, <br>
                  The mirth and fun grew fast and furious; <br>
                  The Piper loud and louder blew, <br>
                  The dancers quick and quicker flew, <br>
                  The reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit, <br>

                  Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair, <br>

                  In longitude tho' sorely scanty, <br>

                  Ae spring brought off her master hale, <br>
