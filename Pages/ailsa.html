Some say the devil sent                    them on to Ireland next,                    stealing                    off                    with some of Scotland&#8217;s treasure, but one of the                    witches let go of her skirts and the precious stone she was                    carrying                    landed                  in the sea and became our Ailsa Craig. Ach, but that's                    not the real story of how Ailsa Craig came to be                    Paddy&#8217;s                milestone (now it marks the distance to Scotland for                Irish fisherman, you see?).<br>                <br>              </font></em><em><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Long                      long ago, before our time, before the time of Tam O&#8217; Shanter,                    Finn MacCuill was the leader of the Fianna, the King of Ireland&#8217;s                    warriors, and the defender of Ulster. He was a magical man                    and a good man; a giant, no one was better at poetry                    or                    wisdom                    than Finn.                    One of his rivals was Benandonner, a Scottish giant who lived                    just across the sea, here in <a href="covenanters.html">Ayrshire</a>.                    Benandonner couldn&#8217;t                    swim across the sea to Ireland for a proper giant&#8217;s                    battle, so Finn tore pieces of rock from Volcanoes into columns                    to                    make the                    causeway                  to Scotland...the Giant's Causeway. Benandonner                    came across the causeway to Ireland to Finn's house, but                    Finn had dressed up as a baby to confuse him. My goodness!                    thought                      Benandonner,                      if the baby is this big, how big must his father be? Suddenly,                      the baby Finn bit the Scottish giant's hand off and Benandonner                      took                      off for Scotland, in a great stramash. When he saw that                    Benandonner was running away, Finn decided to give him something                    else                      for                      good measure.                      He picked                      up wads of Irish earth and started throwing them after                     poor auld Benandonner. The largest hole that he left behind,                      that's                      Lough Neagh (that big lake in the North of                      Ireland) and one large clump of dirt he threw became the                    Isle of Man. But the last rock that Finn threw fell short:                      it landed in the sea near Girvan, and that&#8217;s                    Ailsa Craig that you&#8217;re looking at now.<br>                    <br>              </font></em><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">One summer, I spent hours writing poems in the flat sand left behind                  by the tide, convinced by Gran that the waves would carry my writing                to children on Irish beaches.</font></p>              <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion12" -->      <div align="right"><font size="2" face="Apple Chancery"><a href="covenanters.html">Continue</a></font></div><!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br><br><br><br></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
