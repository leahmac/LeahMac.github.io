                  to London all on her own to see the <a href="betty.html">Coronation</a>. 
                  She lost her beau in the war, they said, and never married, 
                  and maybe she did, but she liked a drink in the Hotel Alhambra 
                  after work. And what a laugh! (The living speak of her laugh 
                  even now, rattling down the decades.) Jean, always too sharp,
