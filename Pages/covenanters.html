I                see shadows                of the                Covenanters                at their secret meetings in the glens, where she points and                instructs. No simple farmer's fields, these, but the land of                Scottish outlaws, John Knox's children, poor folk and rich, who                believed                in their Scottish Kirk. Remembered now not because of their piety                but because the Kirk and the                Covenant stood                for  Scottish freedom &#8211; from French Catholicism and                English Kings. A great irony: in late twentieth century                secular Scotland, my Grandmother found company and solace in                a community                of <a href="londonbus.html">Catholic Poles</a>, attended mass                for many years; she remained a Protestant, identity as a badge                of memory I think, <em>this is who I am</em>. At her funeral                the Polish priest led a blessing and we sang <a href="hymn2.html">hymns</a> from                the Church of Scotland hymnal.</font><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>      <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion8" -->              <blockquote>                <div align="left">                    <p><font size="1" face="American Typewriter">&#8220;The strongest                       and most extreme forms of Covenanting were to be found in                       <a href="bargany.html">Ayrshire</a> and the south west in                       Dumfries and Galloway where dissenting ministers had substantial                       congregations.
