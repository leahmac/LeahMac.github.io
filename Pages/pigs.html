One                    day, it was time for them to make their way in the world,                    and their mother sent them off with the farmer to market                    to sell,                    even though she had tears in her eyes and a fear of bacon                    factories. The little pigs bumped along together for a while,                    and decided                    in conversation that really, they&#8217;d much rather just                    set out</font></em><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> <em>on                    their own, and didn&#8217;t need the farme</em><em>r&#8217;s                    help at all. But do you think they could catch his attention?                    Not                    at all. And there were no windows in that lorry, and when                    they rattled the door from the inside, it wouldn&#8217;t                    budge: it was locked with a great big padlock. The three                    little pigs were                    quite worried. Suddenly, they felt as though they were hurtling                    down a mountainside, and were thrown all in a heap to the                    back of the lorry, thumpety thump, help, and all to the front                    again.                    And oh! suddenly at the bottom of the slope they were all                    three bounced in the air by a huge bump (a sleeping policeman                    probably),                    and when they landed with a smack, and blinked, they were                    amazed to discover themselves sitting on the cobbles.

For a while they huddled together under the                        bridge over the                        burn, and worried.                        What to do?                    &quot;Surely the farmer will notice we&#8217;re missing?&quot;                    said one. &quot;Keep a lookout for the lorry!&quot; said another in                      a quavery voice.                    &quot;He&#8217;ll                      probably send his wolf to look for us&quot;, said the third, almost                      dead with fright.

And there were plenty, just lying around. All        he had to do was walk along the gutters and pick up the rubbish                          that the bad boys                      and girls had thrown away.                    The second little pig decided to build his house out of                      coke cans. &quot;Those are stronger than sweetie wrappers!&quot;,        he thought, &quot;and a lovely                      red colour!                      I&#8217;ll stack them together into walls&quot;.                     But the third little pig, he was determined that the wolf                      would never get into his house. He built his house from                      cement that                      he borrowed from a cement-mixer at the building site next                      to the <a href="girvan1.html">harbour</a>,                      and to make his house even stronger he fetched some rocks                      from the <a href="byneplumb.html">Byne Hill</a>, so the                      walls of his house were sharp and bumpy &#8211; just                      the thing to keep wolves away.</font></em></p>                <p><em><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  One day, almost when they thought they were safe, and were                        getting a wee bit lazy, that wily wolf                        finally found the little pigs' houses. He came to the                        first little                        pig in his house of sweetie                        papers and crisp packets, and shouted &quot;little pig,                        little pig, let me in!&quot;. &quot;Not by the hair of                        my chinny chin chin!&quot;, said the little pig. &quot;Well                        I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!&quot; said                        that big bad wolf...and he did blow the house in, the                        crisp packets lifted up into the air                        like a                        parachute,                        and the first little pig ran squealing to the house of                        his second brother.                    The wolf came to the second house built of coke cans                        then, and begged &quot;little pigs, little pigs, let                        me in!&quot;. &quot;Not                        by the hair of our chinny chin chins!&quot;, said the                        little pigs. &quot;Well I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll                        blow your house in!&quot; said that big bad wolf...and                        he did blow the house in, and the coke                        cans were                        flattened and bounced all over the streets, and the two                        little pigs ran squealing to the house of their third                        brother.                    Finally, the wolf  came to the cement house, and moaned &quot;little                    pig, little pig, let me in!&quot;. &quot;Not by the hair                    of our chinny chin chins!&quot;, said the little pigs, all                    together. &quot;Well                    I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!&quot; said                    that big bad wolf.
