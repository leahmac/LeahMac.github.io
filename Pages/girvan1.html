Robert the Bruce held court here                  many years                  ago, before he was King, and all the other Lords of Carrick. <a href="duncangray.html">Rabbie                  Burns</a> dallied here, too, in his licentious youth. Market                  town, fishing village, holiday destination, haven for smugglers                  and other heroic wanderers who captured my imagination from                  time                  to time&#8230;in                  my lifetime it                lapsed  into late twentieth century decline.

My Gran showed me with stories how to screw up my eyes the just        right way, to see beneath the signs of abandonment to other Girvan times.          My mother never learned this art, and fidgeted for a more cosmopolitan          world.          But me,          I could smell the cod and mackerel at the harbour, see the hunched          fish-wives with their        lightning fast knives, snicker-snack, slicing cleaning, tossing fish          into the creels. At the harbour &#8211; candy floss, pokey hats of          ice cream &#8211; we&#8217;d        sometimes meet Alan McCreth, an old fisherman, who always called my Gran &#8216;<a href="olga.html">wee        Jeannie</a>&#8217;. He wore a flat cap and had a hypnotizing curved gap        in his front teeth from decades of smoking the same old black pipe that        always hung from his mouth.
