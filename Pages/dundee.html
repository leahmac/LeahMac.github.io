                      and coppersmith, and when he became Foreman, he was the
                      youngest
                      on the Clyde.
                      This was at the time when shipping on the Clyde was the
                      pride of <a href="family1.html">Glasgow</a>. Then they called him 'the
                      hat',
                      he wore a bowler, different from the men&#8217;s bunnets,
                      and maybe it protected him, too, when rivets were dropped
                      by accident

  ferry, rotten
