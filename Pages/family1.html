              <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In
                    childhood I was surrounded by a large family, a host of characters,
                    long dead; her magic surrounded our nuclearity with a crowd. <em>&#8220;(God
                    bless) Nan, Polly, Willy, Betty, Jean, Ina and David&#8221;</em>,
                    prayer mantra of Aunts and Uncles, don&#8217;t miss any.
                    Visions of Christmas dinner for forty, <a href="turnberry.html">picnics</a> with gramophones
                    and tartan rugs, and rabble clowning around a
                    piano. And gossip and gossip over tea in <a href="family2.html">Partick </a>&#8211; a <a href="jeelypiece.html">Glasgow</a> neighbourhood
                    of families scrambling up the social ladder. (&#8220;Javad
                    says Partick reminds him of Iran&#8221; says
                    my Aunt of her young Iranian lover, this week). Nan, Great-Grandmother,
                    stares severely from silver-framed black-and-whites, dead
                    at fifty from &#8216;women&#8217;s trouble&#8217;, mysteriously
                    immune to the accretions and character embellishment that
                    have technicolourized the others over time. Who was she?
                    Now I examine
                    the solid outlines of her body and see my own. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">                  David, the young one, the bad boy&#8230;married down (<em>he didn&#8217;t grow up speaking 
                    like that, you know, it was just to annoy us</em>), chopped 
                  off his fingers with a table saw. Horrors! We sat entranced 
                  by the fleshy nubs, unable to look away. <em>Delighted in causing 
                    trouble, that one</em>. In sepia tones, I see him nonetheless 
                  in the flesh, frowning in his Sunday kilt and polished shoes, 
                  forced into Scots respectability. Aunt Polly who went to England 
                  and died, that can happen, you know, but of course it was really 
                  in childbirth. Willy always on horseback in stories, though 
                  it was his Canadian son, Alistair, who was a jockey, won prizes.
