There were four              <a href="poland.html">Polish soldiers</a>, all in their uniforms,              facing each other, two and two, and one of them stood up to let              me sit &#8211; I              was going to my shift watching for fighter planes and bombers.              The              others,              oh they,              flirted,            we expected that.

Your Grandpa&#8217;s Batman, enquiring if I would            care to join Captain Minor for dinner. Your Grandpa was the soldier            who had            stood and given me his seat, I&#8217;d hardly even noticed his face            or his name, but he had notice mine! Of course I said no. But he            sent his            Batman back every day that week, in his shiny boots. After the first            time he never            said anything, just waited patiently. The other girls thought it            was <a href="romantic.html">terribly            romantic</a>. In the end I said yes, of course, partly out of            weariness, and            just to see what would happen. It was the war, you know, it seemed          as if anything was possible.</font></em></p>        <p align="right"><em><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><a href="hymn2.html">Continue</a></font></em></p>      </div>      <!-- InstanceEndEditable --><br></td>    </tr>    <tr>    </tr>    <tr>      <td height="134" valign="top">      <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion8" --><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><br>            </td>            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion6" --><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion7" --><div align="right"></div><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><br>      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br><br><br></body><!-- InstanceEnd --></html>
